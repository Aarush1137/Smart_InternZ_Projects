Once the Gradle sync is successful, you can run the project by clicking the "Run" button (green triangle) in the toolbar or by pressing `Shift` + `F10`. Ensure you have an emulator or a physical Android device connected to your computer for testing.

**Testing:**

Test the application on the emulator or device to ensure it functions correctly.
